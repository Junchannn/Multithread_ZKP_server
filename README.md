# Multithread_ZKP_server

To run this project, you need to have NTL and json lib. This is just a noob project so there are several issues when running the code.
TODO LIST:
- Add dockers
- Use another method to properly spawn requests (there is small delay time right now because i use loop to spawn them)
- PID will escalate very big -> not good
